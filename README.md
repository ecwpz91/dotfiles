## What is a codex?

A codex is a book constructed of a number of sheets of paper, vellum, papyrus, or similar materials, with hand-written contents.

The codex's gradual replacement of the scroll—the dominant book form in the ancient world—has been called the most important advance in book making before the invention of printing.
